## How does it work?

First at all, if not already done, some webpages of _official orientation website_ of the government are scraped and the final the obtained informations are used to do a ranking by sectors and at the date I'm writing this, the official ranking is old of 2022.

Scrapped webpages:

- https://bac.mesrs-ci.net/classement/bts2022
- https://bac.mesrs-ci.net/classement/grdes-ecoles
